## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I received a Bachelorâ€™s degree from Poznan University of Technology (abbr. PUT) in the ICT field in 2025. During these studies I developed interests in Linux, self-hosting and then DevOps, which I decided to pursue as my professional career. Iâ€™ve also written an engineering thesis on IT systems monitoring using a Raspberry Pi. Currently, I am pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in the distributed and cloud systems field at PUT.

In my free time I like to read science fiction books, work on different personal side projects and play video games. I have also recently started learning to play the guitar.
